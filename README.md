These are my dotfiles. If you don't like what I use, GTFO.

You will need bibata-original-ice, waypaper, kitty, swaylock and waybar.
I use pcmanfm and chromium, if you want to use hypr.zip without editing ANYTHING.
Unzip files to ~/.config. If you already have files for these in .config or dotfiles, please delete the old file to mitigate issues.
